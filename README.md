# Design System Playground

#### Build and experiment with front end design systems by setting layout, typography and color controls

--

The basic idea:

1. Take a JSON theme file with design settings
2. Smash that into some components
3. Use React to change the theme state and update the components

A fun experiment built with [Rebass](http://jxnblk.com/rebass/) and [Styled Components](https://www.styled-components.com/).
